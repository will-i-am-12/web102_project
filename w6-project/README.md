# Web Development Project 6 - *Recipe Dashboard*

Submitted by: **William Lu**

This web app: **This app allows you to search through 50 different recipes, displaying each recipe’s name, calorie count, and cooking time. You can also filter and view recipes by cuisine type. On the left, a bar chart visualizes the calorie content of all recipes, while a pie chart on the right shows the distribution of cuisine types. Clicking on a recipe item will take you to a detailed page with more information about the selected dish.**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total
