# Web Development Project 5 - *Recipe Dashboard*

Submitted by: **William Lu**

This web app: **This app is created so you can search for 50 different recipe's name including their calories and the time to cook until ready and it can also filter and display the type of cuisine. This also shows the total recipe, average calories, and max time ready**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **The site has a dashboard displaying a list of data fetched using an API call**
  - The dashboard should display at least 10 unique items, one per row
  - The dashboard includes at least two features in each row
- [X] **`useEffect` React hook and `async`/`await` are used**
- [X] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data** 
  - The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data, such as:
    - *insert details here*
- [X] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
  - The search bar **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the search query
  - The list of results dynamically updates as the user types into the search bar
